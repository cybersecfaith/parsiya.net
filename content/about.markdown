My name is Parsia Hakimian. I am a Security Engineer at the Game and Product Security Engineering group at [Electronic Arts](https://www.ea.com/security) based out of Vancouver in Canada.

Previously, I was a Senior Security Consultant at [Synopsys Software Integrity Group](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity.html) based out of the Washington DC area in the United States.

**Who is Hackerman?**\\
*Hackerman* is a character from the movie [Kung Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg). He is the greatest hacker of all time and can hack people through time. He also has a [hacking tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkrWRHCDQU).

**What is this website?**\\
This website is my security research and notes. It doubles as my cheat sheet and knowledge base along with [parsiya.io](http://parsiya.io). I look up pages or send links to this website at least a few times every day. It's part of my brand. You don't wanna be the other guy from Wham!

**What does "don't be the other guy from Wham!" mean?**\\
[Wham!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wham!) was a popular UK music duo. Most people remember one of its members, George Michael. No one remembers the other guy, [Andrew Ridgeley](https://www.google.com/search?q=andrew+ridgeley). Write a blog, don't be afraid to promote yourself. It's worth it.

<!-- **What do you do?**\\
I hack videogames at Electronic Arts. The bulk of my professional work falls under one-off projects with unique challenges.

I have tested enterprise blockchains, online multiplayer games, stock exchange platforms, mobile device management suites, network appliances, embedded and IoT devices on top of a long list of thickclient/mobile/web applications we all use on a daily basis. -->

**Goals in progress:**

- Using Go in security tooling. I have replaced Python with Go in my workflow.
