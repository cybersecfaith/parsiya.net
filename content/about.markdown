I am Parsia ~~Hackerman~~ Hakimian. Current (mostly) Senior Security Consultant at [Synopsys Software Integrity Group](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity.html) based out of the Washington DC area in the United States.

This is mostly my own security research and notes. This doubles as my cheat sheet and knowledge base. At least a few times a day I look up pages or send links to others from this website.

Bulk of my work falls under one-off projects with unique challenges. I have tested enterprise blockchains, online multiplayer games, stock exchange platforms, mobile device management suites, network appliances, embedded and IoT devices on top of a long list of thickclient/mobile/web applications we all use on a daily basis.

Current goals in progress:

- Using Golang in security tooling.
