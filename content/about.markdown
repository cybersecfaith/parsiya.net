My name is Parsia Hakimian. I am a Senior Security Consultant at [Synopsys Software Integrity Group](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity.html) based out of the Washington DC area in the United States.

*Hackerman* is a character from the movie [Kung Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg). He has also a [hacking tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkrWRHCDQU).

This website is mostly my own security research and notes. It doubles as my cheat sheet and knowledge base along with [parsiya.io](http://parsiya.io). I look up pages or send links to this website at least a few times every day.

The bulk of my professional work falls under one-off projects with unique challenges. I have tested enterprise blockchains, online multiplayer games, stock exchange platforms, mobile device management suites, network appliances, embedded and IoT devices on top of a long list of thickclient/mobile/web applications we all use on a daily basis.

Current goals in progress:

- Using Go in security tooling. I have replaced Python with Go in my workflow.
