I am Parsia Hakimian. Current (mostly) Senior Security Consultant at [Synopsys Software Integrity Group](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity.html) based out of the DC area in United States.

This is mostly my own security research and notes. This doubles as my cheat sheet and knowledge base. At least a few times a day I look up pages or send links to others from this website.

Bulk of my work falls under one-off projects with unique challenges. I have tested enterprise blockchains, online multiplayer games, stock exchange platforms, mobile device management suites, network appliances, embedded and IoT devices on top of a long list of thickclient/mobile/web applications we all use on a daily basis.

My current goals:

- Using Golang in security tooling.
- Learning more about security of smart contracts and enterprise blockchains.
- In-memory fuzzing via binary instrumentation (aka traversing arbitrary assembly blobs over and over and over).
