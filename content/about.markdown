I am Parsia Hakimian. Current (mostly) Senior Security Consultant at [Synopsys Software Integrity Group](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity.html) based out of the DC area in United States.

This is mostly my own security research and notes. This doubles as my cheat sheet and knowledge base. A few times a day I look articles up on this website or send links to others.

These days I mostly work on thick client/reverse engineering assessments, web and mobile applications (Android, iOS and even Windows mobile). My current research interests are Golang, Distributed Ledgers and Transactions (aka blockchain and smart contracts) security, embedded devices, binary instrumentation and in-memory fuzzing.

Below is my relevant experience:

#### Senior Security Consultant @ Cigital/Synopsys - Feb 2016 to Present
Cigital joined Synopsys Software Integrity Group (SIG) in December 2016.

- Learned how to interpret and reverse engineer custom network protocols, make sense of random binary blobs and proxy almost any Windows thickclient.
- Got better at debugging, reverse engineering, function hooking and, reading x86/AMD64 Assembly and memory dumps.
- Tested some IoT devices, mainly PowerPC and ARM. Learned how to read some ARM and PPC Assembly.
- Created and maintained the .NET thick client runbook. The one-stop-shop for learning .NET thickclient assessments.

- Continued testing web applications, web services and all things web.
