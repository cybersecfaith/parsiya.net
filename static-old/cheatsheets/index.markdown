Often I need to do something that I have done many times in the past but I mhave forgotten how to do it. This is a page (or a series of pages if it grows large enough) to give me a repo of how-tos. In this page you may find those commands and tips that I need from time to time (and incidentally forgotten when needed).

Compressing a directory\\
`` tar -zcvf target_tar.tar.gz directory_to_be_compressed``

Decompressing a tar.gz file\\
`` tar -zcvf target_tar.tar.gz path``
