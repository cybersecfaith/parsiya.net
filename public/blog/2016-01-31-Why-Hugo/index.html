<p>As you may have noticed (well no one reads this so I am fine), I have moved from <a href="http://octopress.org" target="_blank">Octopress</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a>. I have been trying to make this change for a while but due to laziness and some other matters it did not happen. I am going to talk about why I decided on the move and what I did. In then ext post I will talk about my migration from Octopress to Hugo.</p>

<h3 id="octopress-the-bad-parts:6e4dd96c118f451aabe1dc11a2f8644f">Octopress the Bad Parts</h3>

<ol>
<li>Octopress had become so slow. Although I do not have many blog posts, they are usually long and contain images and code. Also it does not support incremental generation which means that every time I wanted to push my blog, I had to re-create the blog from scratch. I could live with this because I only do new posts every once in a while so waiting a couple of minutes before deploying the website is not inconvenient.</li>
<li>My main problem was during content creation. Every time I wanted to look at my changes I had to wait 30 seconds and then refresh the page manually to see the changes. This became very inconvenient. I started creating my posts in a local markdown editor (with preview support) and then copy/pasting it into the actual markdown file and looking at the result. However, modifying posts still took a lot of time and effort.</li>
<li>Octopress was written in Ruby. I am not a developer but I have written Ruby code (some of which are closer in your everyday lives than they appear <code>;)</code>) but as you can see in my <a href="http://parsiya.net/blog/2015-07-26-Image-Popup-and-Octopress/" title="Image Popup and Octopress" target="_blank">imgpopup plugin post</a>, creating plugins for Octopress was a pain for me.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="octopress-the-good-parts:6e4dd96c118f451aabe1dc11a2f8644f">Octopress the Good Parts</h3>

<p>Hafiz the famous ancient Persian poet said &ldquo;عیب می جمله چو گفتی هنرش نیز بگو&rdquo; which basically means that you should talk about the strengths [of something] after you have ranted about the problems.</p>

<ol>
<li>Clean theme: The Octopress classic theme is great. I really like it.</li>
<li>It does what it claims. You can install it using a gem and set up your posts and it is probably good to go. Most probably you will not encounter a bug.</li>
<li>Posts can be written in Markdown.</li>
<li>It has a lot of plugins for everyday use out of the box. There are plugins for code, images, videos and tweets.</li>
</ol>

<p>Does this mean that Octopress is a bad static website generator? Not really but it did not work for me.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-wanted:6e4dd96c118f451aabe1dc11a2f8644f">What I Wanted</h3>

<ol>
<li>Be reasonably fast.</li>
<li>Code and image caption plugins. Most static website generators supports code highlight by default but I really like code and image captions. Either it should be supported or I could create my own plugin.</li>
<li>Have the Octopress classic theme or a similar theme.</li>
<li>Allows me to migrate my posts from Octopress. In other words, support writing posts in Markdown. This is supported by almost all static website generators.</li>
</ol>

<p>I could go to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and almost everything would work without problems but creating plugins would be a pain. After all Octopress is built on top of Jekyll. Some call it a fancy front-end for Jekyll but I disagree.</p>

<p>I shopped around looking for static website generator and my final choices were <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/" target="_blank">Pelican</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a>.</p>

<h4 id="pelican:6e4dd96c118f451aabe1dc11a2f8644f">Pelican</h4>

<p>This <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/" target="_blank">post</a> titles &ldquo;Migrating from Octopress to Pelican&rdquo; by Jake Vanderplas was really helpful and that was one of the reasons I almost chose Pelican and even modified most of my posts to work in Pelican.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pelican is reasonably fast. I was amazed after I changed something in my post and saved and the page in browser auto-refreshed with changes within a few seconds.</li>
<li>It is written in Python. Nowadays I write most of my code in Python but creating the plugins were a pain. I fiddled with them for a few days and gave up after I could not create what I wanted.

<ul>
<li>There is a figure with caption plugin called <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/better_figures_and_images" target="_blank">better figures and images</a>.</li>
<li>There is no code caption plugin. I tried creating my own but I got lost. The reason was that because the code is not a one liner (it has an opening tag and closing tag with code int between), I had to create a Markdown pre-processor. There is an <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/blob/master/liquid_tags/include_code.py" target="_blank">Include_code plugin</a> that creates a highlighted code block with caption but it only supports pulling from a file. That would not work for me.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Someone has already done it. <a href="https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme" target="_blank">https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme</a></li>
<li>I only needed to modify some tags but it mostly worked.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pelican was a really good fit. However, the pains that I had to go through in order to create a codeblock with captions plugin (Markdown preprocessor what?), made me skip this and go for Hugo.</p>

<h5 id="hugo:6e4dd96c118f451aabe1dc11a2f8644f">Hugo</h5>

<p>I will talk about why I chose Hugo and the migration in length in the next post. But for now let&rsquo;s see if Hugo is a good fit for my requirements.</p>

<ol>
<li>It is reasonably fast. Similar to Pelican when I modified a Markdown file, the browser auto-refreshed and I could see the changes in a few seconds.</li>
<li>Hugo had neither. However it supports <a href="https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/" target="_blank">shortcodes</a> and I could create both in a few minutes. I will talk about what I did and how I did it in the migration post.</li>
<li>Hugo does not have the classic Octopress theme and this was a big weakness compared to Pelican. But as you can see I made my own. It was a good exercise in learning about the inner workings of Hugo and <code>css</code>.</li>
<li>Not only Hugo supports Markdown, it has an <a href="https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_import_jekyll/" target="_blank">import Jekyll</a> module which works for Octopress. It seems like a good number of people have moved to Hugo from Jekyll because there are a good number Jekyll themes ported to Hugo. For a list of Hugo themes you can visit <a href="https://github.com/spf13/hugoThemes/" target="_blank">this repo</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="conclusion:6e4dd96c118f451aabe1dc11a2f8644f">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Hugo fit my criteria better than Pelican (or any other static website generator that I encountered during my search). It did not have the Octopress classic them but I created my own. In the next blog post I will talk about my migration from Octopress to Hugo.</p>
